To contribute to the editor, you must document _exactly_ how an what the change you wish to implement works.  This means that you must in detail give a broad overview of what the code is for and well document the actual code itself.  From there I will look it over and see if I can anyone else experienced to look it over and see if I am missing anything risky.
If everything looks fine and the code is needed(such as a patch to some bug or a feature that would improve the program), then your contribution will likely be implemented.
Also, one more thing, your contributed code must be licensed under GPL v3 to be included into LibreEditor.
