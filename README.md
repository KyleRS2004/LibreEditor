# LibreEditor
LibreEditor is free and open source text editor that I am writing Java. I am currently learning Java so its technically a learning project.  Still I want the project to be useful for anyone that wants an open source replacement for Notepad on window or on any system that supports Java(in particular I am using the Swing library.)
The "pom.xml" file is the project file for Netbeans IDE.

Minor update: 09/06/2023
I am focusing on college going forward, so I am leaving my current job(its nothing programming related).  So till the end of the week I am going to put the project on pause, but starting on this coming weekend I will continue.  That also maybe how I go about updating/working on the project(weekends only).


Planned:
+ Text file support(opening/editing/saving)
+ Various Menus on the tool bar
+ Editable Text area where you type or read a text file
+ Need to add the ability to scroll down.

Implemented:
+ Editable Text Area
+ Menu bar, Menu bar items, and Menus for the menu bar items(file menu, edit menu, and help menu).
+ Scroll bar
