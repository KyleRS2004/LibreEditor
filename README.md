# LibreEditor
A free java based text editor that I am using to learn Java.
The "pom.xml" file is the project file for Netbeans IDE.

Planned:
+ Text file support(opening/editing/saving)
+ Various Menus on the tool bar
+ Editable Text area where you type or read a text file
+ Need to add the ability to scroll down.

Implemented:
+ Editable Text Area
+ Menu bar & items (still need to make the menus for the items, such as the File Menu)
